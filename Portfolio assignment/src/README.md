My current portfolio demonstrates my understanding of basic HTML and CSS and how well I can incorporate the knowledge I have learned into my code. Considering this is my first assignment, I plan on using this in more ways than one. In one way, I want to show off my basic knowledge and how I have used it to create a portfolio three weeks into my diploma, showing off my potential. And using my first project to compare how far I have come after finishing my course.

When designing my webpage, I decided to keep it simplistic. I chose to have a four-page website, all linking with each other. The four pages are my homepage, the website's introduction, my name, and where I am studyingâ€”about me page, with information about myself, including a link to my resume. Projects page linking three of my current projects (GitHub) 
and my blog page, where there will be descriptions of all my different blog posts with links to an external website directing you to them.

With a beginner portfolio, I am reaching out to companies looking for a junior developer with a basic fundamental knowledge of HTML and CSS. I also hope senior engineers take the time out of their day to give tips on enhancing my current arsenal of skills.

Out of everything, my favorite feature is the text shadowing on the Nav bar. It might be a small detail, but it was something new I learned and enjoyed putting into my portfolio.
